***

Load Impact has the ability to emulate different browsers. This can be changed directly per user scenario using **http.set_user_agent_string()** and **http.set_max_connections()** from our [Load Script API](https://loadimpact.com/load-script-api). Alternatively, you can change the emulation for the entire test using the preconfigured options within Test Configuration:
