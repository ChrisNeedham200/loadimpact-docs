***

This article contains the various IP addresses Load Impact uses to generate load for cloud based tests and other services. The most common reason for needing this information is to open your firewall to allow tests to reach the staging/test environment from a cloud based test.  If you are streaming results to Insights utilizing `k6 run myscript.js -o cloud` you SHOULD NOT need to whitelist anything.

Other methods, such as header or query parameter whitelisting, may also fit your requirements. Refer to [this article]({{ site.baseurl }}/next-gen/how-to-tutorials/how-to-open-firewall-to-load-impact-only/) for more information on those methods.


**The main loadimpact.com IP address:**

52.4.55.233 - Ashburn

### Load Zones

Load Impact uses AWS for cloud load generators. For the IP addresses used in the different load zones and filtering methods please refer directly to [Amazon](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html).

If you prefer to view the ranges directly, within the above link, the [ip-ranges.json](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json) file provides the updated list of IP addresses used by our load generators. In order to know which IP range/s can be used, you need to filter the `service` of type EC2 and the `region` of the selected load zone/s in your test configuration.

The zone codes are mapped as follows:


Code           | Name
---------------|--------------------------
us-east-1      | US East (Ashburn)
us-east-2      | US East (Columbus)
us-west-1      | US West (Palo Alto)

ca-central-1   | Canada (Montreal)
eu-west-1      | EU (Dublin)
eu-central-1   | EU (Frankfurt)
eu-west-2      | EU (London)
