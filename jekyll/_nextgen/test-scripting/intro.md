## Test creation options

There are four primary ways that you can create a test:

- Manually writing the code
- Record a scenario to get the bulk of the test logic generated for you
- Use the HAR-to-k6 converter tool builtin to k6 to convert HAR files to k6 tests
- Use the Postman-to-k6 converter tool to convert Postman collections to k6 tests
