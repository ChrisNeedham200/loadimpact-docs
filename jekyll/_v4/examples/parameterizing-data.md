## Data files/Parameterization

### Reading parameterization data from a CSV file
As k6 doesn't support parsing CSV files out of the box, we'll have to resort to using a Node.js library called [Papa Parse](https://www.papaparse.com/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) (to make it work in k6).

There are a few of steps to make this work:

1. Make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed:
    * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    * [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
2. Install the `Papa Parse` library:

    <kbd>npm install papaparse</kbd>
3. Run it through browserify:

    <kbd>browserify node_modules/papaparse/papaparse.min.js -s papaparse > papaparse.js</kbd>
4. Move the `papaparse.js` file to the same folder as your script file and you'll be able to import it into your test script:

    `import papaparse from "./papaparse.js"`

Here's an example using Papa Parse to parse a CSV file of username/password pairs and using that data to login to the LoadImpact test site:
