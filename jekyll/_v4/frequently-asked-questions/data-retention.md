<h2>Purpose</h2>
This article is intended to provide all the necessary information to questions about LoadImpact's Data Retention plan.

***

## What is Data Retention?

Generally speaking data retention is continued storage of an organisation's data for various reasons. LoadImpact differentiates between test result data and your user data (projects, profiles, test scripts, etc.). In terms of data retention, we are referring only to test result data since your specific user data is saved indefinitely on your user profile.

## How long is my data retained?

Data is retained on a rolling basis, depending on your subscription plan. If you have a Team plan, LoadImpact will save the last 6 months of data. After that period the data is deleted. This rolling period only applies while a customer has an active subscription.  If the user cancels, data is retained for 7 days past subscription expiration.

**Note**
Users can purchase a data retention plan on cancelation of their subscription which would allow them to retain the data without having the ability to run tests.

## Can I export my data?

Yes, data can be exported, we have more information available over here: [How to export the CSV data]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _4.0/result-analysis/csv-result-data-export/#how-to-export-the-csv-data %})

## When can I purchase Data Retention

Data retention is automatically included in every subscription plan and the time your data is retained depends on specific plan you have purchased. For more info on specific plans and corresponding data retention periods please visit our [pricing](https://loadimpact.com/pricing/) page.

**Note**
Our annual plans allow for customised parameters based on your specific needs, including a prolonged data retention plan. Please contact us for more information.
