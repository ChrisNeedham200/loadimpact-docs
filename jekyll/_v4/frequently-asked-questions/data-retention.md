<h2>Purpose</h2>
This article is intended to provide all the necessary information to questions about LoadImpact's Data Retention plan.

***

## What is Data Retention?

Generally speaking data retention is continued storage of an organisation's data for various reasons. LoadImpact differentiates between test result data and your user data (projects, profiles, etc.). In terms of data retention, we are referring only to test result data. Your specific user data and test configuration data is saved indefinitely on your user profile.

## How long is my data retained?

Data is retained on a rolling basis, depending on your subscription. For plans with 1 month of data retention, we will retain data for 30 days from the test run. After that period the data is deleted. This rolling period only applies while you have an active subscription.  If you cancel your subscription, data is retained for 7 days past subscription expiration.

**Note:**
You can purchase a data retention plan during cancelation of your subscription. This allows you to retain your result data at a lower rate between testing periods.

## Can I export my data?

Yes, data can be exported, for more information on exporting data, refer to this article: [How to export the CSV data]({{ site.baseurl }}/4.0/result-analysis/csv-result-data-export/})

## When can I purchase Data Retention

A period data retention is automatically included in every subscription plan. The time your data is retained depends on specific plan you have purchased. For more info on specific plans and corresponding data retention periods please visit our [pricing](https://loadimpact.com/pricing/) page.

**Note:**
For periods of data retention longer than specified in our plans, please reach out to support for pricing information.
