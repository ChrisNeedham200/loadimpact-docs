#### How do I share an ongoing test run and test results?

Once a new test has started to run it is immediately possible to share the test in its current status by clicking on Share these results.


This unique generated Public URL will allow access to this specific test only and will be active and accessible at any future date.

#### Public URL

Public URL is contained in the format :
https://app.loadimpact.com/load-test/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

To share the Public URL simply copy the generated Public URL and distribute.


Upon exiting a test run and logging out of your account, the unique Public URL will remain static and visible and will continue to link to the specific test run.
