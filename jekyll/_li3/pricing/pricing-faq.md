Here are some of our most frequently asked questions about pricing.  If your question isn't answered here, please contact support.


### Does Load Impact have a concept of VU Hours?

No - There is no concept of VU hours for our plans.  You can run all your tests up to the maximum limits as defined by your subscription

### Can I pay with a PO or Wire tranfer?

Yes - please contact sales or support to initiate the process

### Do plans autorenew?

Yes - our online plans will autorenew, however they can be canceled at any time in app, for any reason.

### How do I get an invoice/receipt for my purchase?

To get a invoice/receipt for your purchase:
Click drop down next to your name in app -> billing
Scroll down to the “Payments” category.
Click the “View receipt” button.

You can choose to either save or print the receipt. Your receipt number is considered your invoice number.

### Do I get credits/tests back if a test is aborted?

For tests executed under a subscription/add-on, tests aborted by user will count towards your test limit.  It's highly recommended that you double check your configuration and/or run smaller tests to work out low level issues in the case of an add-on.  If you have an extenuating circumstance, please reach out and we will see if we can make an exception.

For tests aborted by the system or script error, these tests do not count against your test limit and will not consume a test.  No action is needed on your part.

For credit based tests, if you abort it early. We will automatically refund different amounts depending on when you aborted the test:

- If the test is aborted before it has run 10% of the time configured, we refund 100% of the credits spent on the test
- If the test is aborted when it has run between 10% and 49% of the time configured, we refund 50% of the credits spent on the test
- If the test is aborted when it has run 50% or more of the time configured, no credits will be automatically refunded (but let us know if some extenuating circumstance occurred, we may be able to make an exception)

The reason we don’t refund exactly the amount of credits that correspond to the amount of time that was left on the test is that we allocate a lot of cloud infrastructure resources before each test and have to pay for those resources for the next hour. Sometimes we can re-use resources from an aborted test, but not always.

### What are credits?

Credits are the virtual currency used to execute load tests on a pay-per-test basis.

#### If you want to buy credits, what do they cost?

The base cost of 1 credit is $1. If you have no credits at all and try to run a load test that's beyond our free subscription level, the system will tell you that you need more credits, and offer to let you purchase the credits you need. This means that you never have to buy anything from us until the very moment you want to run your load test – you can always "pay-per-test”.

Pay-per-test credits are only one way to pay for tests. You can also purchase a monthly subscription which is generally more cost effective.

#### But you can run tests without even registering an account, can’t you?

Yes, when you are not logged on, you can always run anonymous tests from the loadimpact.com start page. However, results from anonymous tests are indexed by search engines and publicly displayed for all to see. As they are fully automatic, they can also not be configured in any way – you can’t decide exactly what pages will be loaded during the test or what load levels will be used.

#### Where do I purchase pay-per-test credits?

Pay-per-test credits can be purchased in app upon configuring a test that falls outside of your subscription. i.e. if you configure a test with 2000 VUs and you have a standard plan, you will be asked to purchase credits.  You can also purchase credits directly using this link.
