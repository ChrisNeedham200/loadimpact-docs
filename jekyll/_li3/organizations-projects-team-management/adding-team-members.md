Team members are other users within your [organization](organizations) that you would like to participate in your organization in Load Impact.  To add Team Members you must first invite them to the parent organization.  This is done through Organizations and Projects menu or the "+" menu in the upper right corner of the platform.

Either use the Organizations and project menu

or the  "+" sign

Next, click "Add Member" and type the email of the team member you wish to invite and assign them the correct permission level, and projects (if they are a read/write member).

Read/Write members can create user scenarios, data stores, test configurations and execute test runs for assigned projects.
Admin users have full access, like the account owner.
