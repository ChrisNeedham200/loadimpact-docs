Congratulations! By now you have likely finished running and analyzing your first set of tests. You probably have some interesting, actionable results. However, it's also possible that you've only scratched the surface of performance testing with Load Impact.

Our most successful clients often take their performance testing to the next level by taking advantage of the following:

### Building more realistic user scenarios

Read our Scripting Guide and the Load Script API to make your tests even more realistic. Do you need to simulate a certain browser, set user a user agent or even just log some information during the test?

### Getting more metrics in tests

You get many great metrics from our tests, but you can get many more with Server Monitoring. Using our Server Monitoring Agents or our integration with New Relic, you can paint a complete picture of what's happening in your application and on your server during a test. Does VU Load Time unexpectedly increase? Maybe that correlated with 100 percent utilization of the CPU on the target machine. These monitoring agents allow you to correlate that data during and after your test run.

### Collaborating with other team members

You can invite your team to be part of your Load Impact account to share data, run tests and create user scenarios with our Organizations feature. As the admin of an account you can control what those users are able to access. Maybe you need to invite a junior engineer to help on a project or your CTO to view your app's performance improvement. This feature allows you to grant access the way you want it.

### Scheduling tests to run automatically

Running a single test can give you some great information. Taking action on that information and comparing it to the next test run is even better. Our most successful users schedule tests to run automatically and build a performance trend over time. This has helped them identify performance issues before they become problems.

### Staying organized

Group similar load tests together with our Projects feature. Whether you're an engineer who is testing multiple functionalities through different tests, or you're a consultant who needs to keep their work with different companies organized, Projects is a great way to stay organized and keep yourself away from a data overload.
