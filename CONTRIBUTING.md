# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in the LoadImpact documentation.  This document is intended to be a guide to creating proper and clear documentation. 


## Document structure

All documentation should follow similar structure to remain clear and familar to all readers. 

1. Front Matter:  The front matter consists of various meta data to be used by Jekyll to generate a page. 
2. Horizontal Rule:  Sections should be separated with horizontal rule.  Notably, a horizontal rule should be positioned after the Front Matter by using 3 asterisks `***`. A blank line must exist before and after the horizontal rule.
3. Background/Purpose: Every article should start with a background or purpose section which explains the article content. This section should be contained in HTML H2 header tags. `<h2>Background</h2>`. 
4. Table of contents:  A table of contents should be included for articles that contain 4 or more sections 
5. Sections:  Organize content into relevant sections using h2 markdown headers `##`.  For subsections, increase the header level by 1.
6. See Also: All documents should contain a final section `See Also`. This section should contain all major links used in the article.

Refer to the following document template for an example (to be added later)
